/**
 * SYNOPSIS
 *  Sequencer --- (AKA "RoboOp") Implements a state machine for automated sequencing of FT8 QSOs
 *
 * !!!DON'T PANIC!!!
 *  Following the progress of a large state machine like this is challenging.
 *  While the complete FT8 implementation accommodates arcane corner cases to
 *  handle unexpected, exceptional events, the main flow is not so bad.
 *  Here's the main flow for how the Sequencer initiates a QSO by calling CQ:

 *    4       XMIT_RRR      timeslotEvent   N/A                 LISTEN_73   Transmit RRR
 *    5       LISTEN_73     eotMsgNoReplyEvent        N/A                 IDLE        QSO finished normally
 *
 *  The above includes events arising from three sources:  timeslot boundaries, GUI buttons,
 *  and received messages.  For many events, Sequencer undertakes one of two actions:
 *  prepare a message to transmit, or arm the transmitter to begin in an appropriate timeslot.
 *  The reference [1] below provides more information about sequencing an FT8 QSO.
 *
 *  All FT8 messages, received and transmitted, worldwide, start on 15-second
 *  timeslot intervals.  The intervals begin precisely at 0, 15, 30 and 45 seconds
 *  past a minute boundary.  Each message is of a fixed bit length, and requires
 *  12.6 seconds to transmit, the remaining dwell time is available for decoding
 *  messages and preparing a response, if any.  Consider what happens in the
 *  following sequence adopted from [1] below (Sequencer's state, event and action
 *  names are ommitted to simpify the discussion):
 *
 *  Timeslot  Destn Source  Content Commentary
 *     0      CQ    K1JT    FN20    K1JT transmits CQ
 *     1                            K1JT listens but hears no response
 *     2      CQ    K1JT    FN20    Retransmit CQ
 *     3                            K1JT again hears no response
 *     4      CQ    K1JT    FN20    Retransmit CQ
 *     5      K1JT  K9AN    EN50    K9AN responds to K1JT with their grid square locator
 *     6      K9AN  K1JT    -10     K1JT sends K9AN's signal report (dB)
 *     7      K1JT  K9AN    R-12    K9AN rogers the report and transmits K1JT's report
 *     8      K9AN  K1JT    RRR     K9AN rogers the received report
 *     9      K1JT  K9AN    73      Traditional QSO ending
 *
 *  K1JT is [re]transmitting CQ during even-numbered timeslots and listening for responses
 *  in odd-numbered timeslots.  K9AN replies during an odd-numbered timeslot to avoid
 *  "doubling" with K1JT's transmissions.  If K9AN initially decodes K1JT's CQ during
 *  timeslot 4, they had 2.4 seconds, at most(!), to choose to respond in the following
 *  timeslot (5).  If they procrastinated, then K9AN's response would necessarily
 *  have to wait for the next odd numbered timeslot (7) as K1JT will likely retransmit CQ
 *  during timeslot 7.
 *
 *  Proper sequencing is important, and is most effectively automated due to the short
 *  dwell time available between when a message is decoded, displayed and the following
 *  timeslot begins.  Human operators simply can't prepare a message in time to send
 *  in that next timeslot --- that's why we have RoboOp (if you've ever worked a CW
 *  contest at 02:00 local time then you know the job).  Now consider the following in
 *  which K1JT's response is lost in the ozone:
 *
 *  Timeslot Destn Source  Content Commentary
 *     0      CQ    K1JT    FN20    K1JT transmits CQ
 *     1      K1JT  K9AN    EN50    K9AN responds to K1JT with their grid square locator
 *     2      K9AN  K1JT    -20     K9AN listens but K1JT's transmission is lost in noise
 *     3      K1JT  K9AN    EN50    K9AN retransmits their grid square locator
 *     4      K9AN  K1JT    -20     K1JT retransmits the lost signal report
 *     5      K1JT  K9AN    R-12    K9AN rogers the received report and transmits K1JT's report
 *     6      K9AN  K1JT    RRR     K9AN rogers the received report
 *     7      K1JT  K9AN    73      Traditional QSO ending
 *
 *  In the above, having heard nothing in timeslot 2, K9AN retransmits their grid square in
 *  timeslot 3 (when K1JT should be listening) in hope of recovering the QSO.  After
 *  successfully receiving K9AN's retransmission in timeslot 3, K1JT retransmits the
 *  signal report lost in timeslot 2.  In general, if nothing is heard when listening
 *  for a remote station to respond to our previous transmission, we retransmit the
 *  previous message.
 *
 *  For the purpose of logging, Sequencer considers a QSO successfully completed when it
 *  receives any form of end-of-transmission (EOT), e.g. RRR, RR73, or 73, from the
 *  remote station ("It aint over till it's over").  Note this is a bit different from
 *  some contests and/or special events --- we're a bit conservative here.
 *
 *  Unexpected FT8 messages, those deviating from the so-called "standard" QSO sequence
 *  described in [1], present Sequencer with a quandry re. what to do as the documented
 *  protocol doesn't really prescribe what to do (i.e. when compared to, say, the TCP
 *  RFCs:).  The easiest thing to do would likely be abandon the QSO, but
 *  Sequencer attempts to get things back on track below.  It's confusing, and much of
 *  the code below addresses the arcane situations when the QSO flows abnormally.
 *
 * DESIGN
 *  Sequencer implements a state machine, driven by event notification methods,
 *  and responds by invoking action methods.  There are two "main" forms of events,
 *  timeslots and received messages.  Others (e.g. Timers) deal with oddities.
 *  RoboOp is a lot of code, but it attempts to behave as would a (very fast) human
 *  operator.
 *
 *  Sequencer expects to be notified about received messages in the timeslot in which they
 *  are decoded (so it can prepare a response to transmit in the following timeslot).
 *  If this doesn't happen for some reason, sequencer is aware of even/odd timeslots and
 *  will pend its response until a suitable timeslot when the remote station should be
 *  listening.  The QSO can get really fouled up beyond all recognition (FUBAR) if the
 *  remote station changes their even/odd timeslot for transmissions.
 *
 *  Sequencer employs a timer to recognize QSO wreckage (changing band conditions,
 *  remote station QRT, whatever) and abort its automated activities.
 *
 * NOMENCLATURE
 *  "Events" refer to things (e.g. received messages, timeslot boundaries, menu
 *  buttons, timers...) that trigger the state machine.
 *  "Actions" refer to the activities undertaken by the state machine in response to
 *  events.

 * @brief Process received CQ message event
 *
 * If the operator has enabled automatic responses with the Tx button, the Sequencer ("RoboOp") automatically
 * responds to the first received CQ if we aren't already engaged in another activity (e.g. calling CQ ourself
 * or in an unfinished QSO).  EXCEPT:  By default, RoboOp ignores duplicate entries from the log.
 *
 * You may question why we need RoboOp.  Between the receipt of a CQ and the first opportunity to respond is
 * the FT8 "dwell" time of <= 2.6 seconds.  If we miss that timeslot opportunity, then we have to
 * sit out yet another timeslot (30 seconds so far) before the next chance to reply without doubling with the
 * remote station's CQ transmissions.  Thus, without RoboOp, we have only 2.6 secondes (at most) to
 * respond if we wish to avoid the 30 second penalty.  RoboOp is faster than a 70-yo CW operator at the
 * low end of 20 meters.  ;)
